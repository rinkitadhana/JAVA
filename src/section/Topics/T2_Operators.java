        TYPES OF OPERATORS

       1. Unary Operators

     ++ (Increment) This operator is used to increment the value by 1. There are two types of increment, i.e., post-increment (a++) and pre-increment (++a)
     -- (Decrement)	This operator is used to decrement the value by 1. There are two types of decrement, i.e., post decrement (a–) and pre decrement (–a)
      ! (Invert)	This operator is used to invert a boolean value (!a).

       2. Arithmetic Operators

      + ( Addition)	      This operator is used to add the value of the operands.
      – ( Subtraction)	  This operator is used to subtract the right-hand operator with the left hand operator.
      * ( Multiplication) This operator is used to multiply the value of the operands.
      / ( Division)	      This operator is used to divide the left hand operator with right hand operator.
      % ( Modulus)        This operator is used to divide the left hand operator with right hand operator and returns remainder.

       3. Assignment Operators

      =	This operator is used to assign the value on the right to the operand on the left.
     +=	This operator is used to add right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
     -=	This operator subtracts right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
     *=	This operator multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
     /=	This operator divides left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
     ^=	This operator performs exponential calculation on operators and assigns value to the left operand
     %=	This operator is used to divide the left-hand operator with right hand operator and assigns the result to left operand.

       4. Logical Operators

     && (Logical AND)	This operator returns True if both the operands are true, otherwise, it returns False.
     || (Logical OR)	This operator returns True if either the operands are true, otherwise it returns False.
      ! (Logical AND)	This operator returns True if an operand is False. It reverses the logical state of an operand.

       5. Shift Operators

     << (Left Shift)	This operator left shifts the bits of the first operand; the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
     >> (Right Shift)	This operator right shifts the bits of the first operand; the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

       6. Bitwise Operators

     & (Bitwise AND)	This operator takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every  bit of two numbers.
     | (Bitwise OR)	    This operator takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every  bit of two numbers.
     ^ (Bitwise XOR)	This operator takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every  bit of two numbers.
     ~ (Bitwise NOT)	This operator takes one number as an operand and does invert all bits of that number.

       7. Ternary Operators

    Syntax : ( Condition ) ? ( Statement1 ) : ( Statement2 );
    Here Condition is the expression to be evaluated which will return the boolean value.
    If the Condition result is True then Statement1 will be executed. If the Condition result is false then Statement2 will be executed.

       8. Relational Operators

      < (Less than)	                This operator returns True, if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, else it returns False.
      > (Greater than)	            This operator returns True, if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, else it returns False.
      <= (Less than or equal to)    This operator returns True, if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, else it returns False.
      >= (Greater than or equal to) This operator returns True, if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, else it returns False.
      == (Equal to)	                This operator returns True, if two operands are equal, else it returns False.
      != (Not equal to)             This operator returns True, if two operands are not equal, else it returns False.
